# Free and Open Art License

A copyleft license for digiral artwork that cover where Creative Commons and Free Art License falls short.

## Why

The author is fed up with the 3D modeling market he has to deal with while playing VRChat. Everything is expensive. So he decides to lean Blender himselves and make a license that actully enforces freedom.

* Users of an FOAL licensed derived work must share the original work
* Unlike GPL or LGPL. FOAL is not "contagious"
  * Modified FOAL work is still FOAL. But when combined with other work, it does not make the entire work FOAL
  * You can use FOAL work in your proprietary work. As long as you share the original and modified FOAL work
* FOAL encourages free distribute, modification and use of artwork.

## Disclaimer

IANAL, I am an engineer/programmer/developer. Also this license is written mostly by ChatGPT and cross checked by a local RWKV model. It ultimatelly looks good to me so I uploaded it.
